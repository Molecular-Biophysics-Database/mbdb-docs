# BLI intro

BLI covers the output of Bio-layer interferometry measurements. 
The current model ensures compatibility the Octet series from Satorius.
However, we're not aiming to exclusively capture data from this instrument 
platform, so please contact us at mbdb@ibt.cas.cz if there are 
incompatibilities with the instrument you used, and we will adjust 
the model to accommodate your data.
