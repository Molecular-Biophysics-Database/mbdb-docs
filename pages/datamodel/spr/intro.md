# SPR introduction

SPR covers the output of Surface plasmon resonance measurements. 
The current model ensures compatibility the Biacore series of instruments
from Cytiva. However, we're not aiming to exclusively capture data from this instrument 
platform, so please contact [MBDB](mailto:mbdb@ibt.cas.czsubject=SPR%20compatibility) if there are 
incompatibilities with the instrument you used, and we will adjust 
the model to accommodate your data.
