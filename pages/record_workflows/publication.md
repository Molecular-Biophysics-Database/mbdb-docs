# Publication workflow

## Creating a draft record

Drafts can be created at any point by any person, provided that they have an
ORCID and uses that ORCID to register in our system (ORCIDs are free and easy to
make, see [here](https://orcid.org/)).

When a record is in the draft state, only you, the creator can access the record
along side the editor and the administrator (see [roles](mbdb_roles.md) for
details).

There's no restrictions on how much you can edit your draft, and how long it
takes you to do so.

## Submitting the record

When you're satisfied with the record, you can be submit it for review. You will
not be able to submit before the draft passes validation, which checks that all
required fields are filled, and that all fields with content contains valid data
(e.g. no text in fields that only supports numbers).

Once the draft is submitted you will not able edit it.

## Reviewing the record

While the draft is being reviewed you will not be able to make changes to it.
The alternative would be a nightmare for the reviewer.

The reviewer can then either chose to accept the draft, or reject it. In case
the record gets rejected, it returns to the draft state and you can edit your
draft and submit it again.

## Publishing the accepted record

When the draft has been accepted, it can be published as soon or late as you
want, there's no deadline for doing so.

## Cancelling the publication workflow

Cancelling the publication of a record (i.e. returning it to draft state), can
be done once the record has been accepted. While it's under review it cannot be
cancelled.

## Deleting record during the workflow

The record can be deleted at any point during the publication work flow, note
the difference between unpublished and published records in terms of
[deletion](deletion.md).
