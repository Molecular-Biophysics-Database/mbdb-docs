# Licensing overview

We distinguish between two different areas when we talk about licensing, namely:

 1. The software that powers the MBDB
 2. The individual records that are deposited on the MBDB

As there's different needs for these areas, their licenses also differ (see below).

## Software licensing

The software is distributed under the very permissible [MIT license](https://github.com/Molecular-Biophysics-Database/mbdb-app/blob/development/LICENSE).

## Record (data files with metadata)

For published records, the data is distributed under the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).


## Citing the MBDB

We encourage citation of the individual records directly as well as the MBDB itself:

Example citation:
  1. Record of awesomeness, P. Eople, E. Tal, 2024, MBDB.
  2. MBDB, the FAIR database for Molecular Biophysics. P. Erson, O. Ther. Journal of stuff, 2025.
