# External resources

## Overview

For reasons of compatibility as well as trying to avoid reinventing the wheel, the MBDB relies on a number of external resources.

In particular, we rely on the following resources:

  1. [InChI keys and Pubchem](chemicals.md) (for chemicals)
  1. [NCBI taxonomies](organisms.md) (for organisms)
  2. [ROR](affiliations.md) (for affiliations)
  3. [OpenAire](grants.md) (for funding)


## Implementation

Regardless of which resources is being used, they get incorporated as so-called vocabularies (Invenio term). The vocabularies can be thought as
prefilled form similar to when you type in your first name and then your last name, and email address are automatically filled in if you have save it in your browser.
