# Welcome to the documentation of MBDB!

## What is MBDB?

MBDB is a data repository for providing rich metadata along raw measurement
data from Biophysical techniques. It strives to adhere to the
[FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).
Furthermore, MBDB makes the raw measurement data citable by issuing Digital
Objection Identifiers (DOIs), through [DataCite](https://datacite.org/).
