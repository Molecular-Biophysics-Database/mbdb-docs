# ROR 

Our source of information for affiliations is the [ROR database](https://ror.org/).

## How is the information accessed?  

We're accessing ROR from within the MBDB by making calls to their [REST API](https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api). 

## I can't find my affiliation, what do I do?

The registration of an affiliations can be initiated [here](https://ror.org/registry/). Although the registration is fast, it can take 2-4 weeks before the affiliation becomes available.

Note that affiliations aren't mandatory, so you will still be able to deposit the record even if you are unable to give an affiliation.
