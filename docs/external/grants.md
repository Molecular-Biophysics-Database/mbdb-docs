# OpenAire projects

We're currently relaying on OpenAire, in particular OpenAire projects to extract funding information.

## How is the information accessed?  

We're accessing the information from within the MBDB using their [REST API](https://graph.openaire.eu/develop/api.html#projects).

## I can't find my funding information, what should I do? 

Funding information isn't mandatory, so you will still be able to deposit the record even if you are unable to give an affiliation.
